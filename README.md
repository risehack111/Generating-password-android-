# Generating_password_android
This application is developed by Android Studio. This application is designed to generate a random password.
To create a password, you must specify the length in the "String length" field. The maximum password length is 99 characters. If you do not specify the length of the password, and press "GEN" then the application will randomly generate a number in the "Line length" field.
If you need to generate a password from simple letters, you just need to press "GEN".
If you need to create a password using letters and special characters, then you need to activate the Switch called "Text and Special Characters". If you need to create a password using letters and numbers, then you need to activate the Switch called "Text and numbers". If you need to make a combo, then activate both Switches.
After generating the password, it is saved to the clipboard of your device.
